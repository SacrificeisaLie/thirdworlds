Foundational Methods for Creative Computing One Coursework 

Initially I wanted to center my game around cryptography, giving the player a cypher they would need to decipher in order to progress.
But then whilst designing it became evident that the effort needed to solve these cyphers outweighs the reward and significance of my game,
ultimately being a waste of the player's time. My game is meaningless and the only motivation behind itâ€™s creation is for me not to fail the shcool year.
Once I came to this realization I chose to fully embrace these motivations as themes and have them be reflected in the game's design.

Tip: 
Play with high monitor brightness
