Foundational Methods for Creative Computing One Coursework 

Initially I wanted to center my game around cryptography, giving the player a cypher they would need to decypher in order to progress.  
But then whilst designing it became evident that the effort needed to solve these cyphers outways the reward and significance of my game and ultimately would be a waste of time for the player.My game is meaningless and the only reason for it's creation is in order for me not to fail. 
Once I realized my true motivations for making this game I chose to fully embrace them and have them be reflected in it's design.  


Tip: 
Play with high monitor birghtness
